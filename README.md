# Task Overview
The FastAPI backend for a modular portal is currently experiencing CORS errors when authenticated endpoints are accessed from the frontend application. Public endpoints work as expected, but authentication requests from the frontend fail due to improper CORS configuration or middleware ordering. Your objective is to resolve this problem so that authenticated cross-origin requests succeed.

# Guidance
- The backend is modularized with routers for public and authenticated endpoints.
- CORS middleware is added, and custom dependencies handle authentication.
- Proper CORS handling is critical for cross-origin authentication requests from the frontend.
- All necessary configuration and startup scripts are provided.
- Focus specifically on resolving the CORS issue for authenticated endpoints.

# Objectives
- Ensure authenticated endpoints respond with correct CORS headers for allowed origins.
- Confirm that both public and authenticated endpoints are fully accessible cross-origin from the frontend domain.
- Maintain a clear and modular FastAPI backend structure throughout any changes.

# How to Verify
- Access public and authenticated endpoints from an allowed frontend origin and confirm both succeed without CORS errors.
- Use tools like browser dev-tools or curl to check for the presence of correct CORS headers on both endpoint types.
- Attempt authenticated cross-origin requests and verify proper functionality and headers.
